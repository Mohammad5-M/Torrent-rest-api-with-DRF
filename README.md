# Torrent-rest-api-with-DRF

Torran

this is my first restful api project created in django
you can create an account in register page
torran just an API for torrent files
you can use it by set query in url like this /api?q=the grand tour
or you can use id instead of q ,like this /api?id=1 (every item has specific id)
